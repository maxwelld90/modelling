# User Search Interfaces, User Modelling and (Maybe) Simulation
A repository containing work for work on my postdoc at TUDelft, examining user behaviours to generate new models and tools (maybe with simulations). Lots of little experiments are in here! Below is a list of the data.

| **Path**                         | **Description** |
| -------------------------------- | --------------- |
| `exploratory/cscw-markov`        | First pass, exploratory analysis for analysing CSCW data with the aim of generating Markov models |
| `exploratory/cscw-markov-collab` | Second pass, continuing analysis from the first pass. Exploring CSCW collaborative data. Does it differ from non-collaborative? |

## Todo Points

- Need to clean up the logs, with a 1 second minimum time for a widget to be counted as hovered over.
- Maybe include clicks, but there is a risk that could lead to a lot of spurious data.
